# Genotyping-Error-Rate
This script is to identify differences in genotypes between two input files. You can then use these differences to calculate genotyping error rate using Pompanon et al. (2005)

#Info about script:
#Make sure your input files are unix-LF endings and are tab-delimited textfiles.
#This script was written for Bentley and Mauricio (In Prep)
#In input file, KZ## are the names of the loci
